# Wellcome to Dixie

Dixie is the result of my final degree project, an online graph-oriented particle motor. Just connecting and editing the provided nodes you'll be able to create complex behaviours for the particles.  The main libraries used in the project are:
* **[Litegl.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/litegl.js?files=1)**  &rarr; A library that simplifies working with WebGL without the low-level calls but without losing any freedom.
* **[Litegraph.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/litegl.js?files=1)**  &rarr; A library to create graphs in the browser similar to Unreal Blueprints.

[Learn more about the online editor here :books:]()

**Fell the interoperability!** &rarr; Use the API to import the work done to your environment. [Learn more here :books:]()  
**ThreeDixie** &rarr; The official support for Three.js allows a cleanly and easily way to import your particles. [Learn more here :books:]() 

## Why you should use Dixie?

:stars::stars::stars: Because it's free, open-source, highly interoperable and fully customizable!  :stars::stars::stars:

## Functionalities
With Dixie you're able to:
 * Create a set of particle emitters
 * Define the origin of the particles as:
	 * A point in the space
	 * The surface of a mesh
 * Define particle subemitters
 * Modify the particle properties directly or using equations
 * Set your own textures as:
	 * One texture
	 * An atlas of textures
	 * Animated textures
 * Apply external forces to the particles like:
	 * Gravity
	 * Magnet point
	 * Vortex
